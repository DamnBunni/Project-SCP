# PROJECT: SCP
# THIS IS THE OFFICIAL PROJECT: SCP GITHUB.
Welcome to the official github site for the downloads of **Project: SCP - Reborn**
A Minecraft map that has a mix of SCP:Secret Laboratory and SCP:Containment Breach to make a modded horror map based on the SCP:Foundation

# History
The project first began in around 2019 and its first ever version released somewhere in around 2019-2020 possibly around the end of 2019.
In 2021 the project files were lost due my dumbass not having saved the files on my pc which broke down.
And finally at around the beginning of 2022 the map was being worked on again but is now completely different from the previous maps and I just hope that nothing bad will happen this time and I will be able to finish the game.

# You can find all the downloads for the Map and Mods
Fyi this shit was written by Krypt not Destiny, I am working on this project now.
